                    <p>Every day, more than 11 million guests visit Burger King restaurants around the world.

Founded in 1954, Burger King is the second largest fast food hamburger chain in the world. The original Home of the Whopper, our commitment to premium ingredients, signature recipes, and family-friendly dining experiences is what has defined our brand for more than 50 successful years.</p>

                    <h2>The Whopper</h2>
                    <p>It is noteworthy that, as it is Burger King's main hamburger, the way it is made is perfectly defined. The perfect Whopper is called a "Gold Whopper." Depending on the restaurant's offering, nowadays the Whopper is also offered with two (Double Whopper) or three servings of meat, optionally accompanied with crispy smoked bacon, American cheese, or both.</p>
